<b>
<p>The Old World</p>
</b>
<p>For thousands of years, three great races, elves, orcs, and dwarves,
dominated these great lands. From time to time a great leader would unite the
various tribes of one of the races and their influence and power would eclipse
the others. However, this dominance was fleeting and was always diminished by
war, death, and corruption. Their were many other races, goblins, gnomes, ogres,
gnolls, and hobbits. These minor races were scattered through out the lands, but
never in numbers that could challenge the greater races. Thus the world changed
very little from one century to the next. Then everything changed. A new race
arrived. A tribe of nomads wandered out of the Ice Desert. Not elf, orc, dwarf,
or any of the minor races. It was a new race that combined the best
characteristics of each of the great races. They had the intelligence of the
elves, the ingenuity of the Dwarves, and the strength of the orcs. In the
beginning, the new race was known as the ice people. But over time, they came to
be called… human.</p>
<b>
<p>The Ice People</p>
</b>
<p>Where the Ice People came from and why they came the great lands have long
been forgotten. The dwarves of the Northern Range were the first to encounter
them. The dwarves were enthusiastic to establish trade with surface dwellers and
quickly established a harmonious relationship with the newcomers. The dwarves
found the humans to be eager learners and they taught them metal working and
mining skills.</p>
<p>Eventually as more humans arrived and their population grew, the Ice people
enter the low lands. Once in the low lands, they were captured and enslaved by
various orc tribes. Because the orcs were almost always at war with the other
races and other orc tribes, humans quickly learned a great deal about various
weapons and types of warfare.</p>
<b>
<p>The Orc Wars and the Alliance</p>
</b>
<p>Under the great orc leader, Rocar the Mighty, the orc tribes united and
fought a fierce war with the elves and dwarves. In order to defeat the combined
orc armies, the dwarves and elves encouraged the enslaved humans to rebel
against their orc master by secretly providing them with weapons and training.</p>
<p>The human-dwarf-elf alliance proved a formidable adversary to the orcs, but
not an invincible one. The orc wars raged for years. One of the great advantages
of the alliance was the ability of the elves to use magic against the orcs. But
there were not enough elven wizards to support the war effort. In order to
increase the pool of magic users, the elves began to train humans in the arts of
wizardry.</p>
<p>Though the alliance was powerful, the united orc tribes under the forceful
rule of Rocar proved too powerful and continued to conquer elven and dwarven
lands. All seemed lost until a small group of humans, dressed as slaves,
infiltrated Rocar’s war camp and in suicide attack, killed Rocar. Though none
of the humans in the attacked survived, the effect was devastating on the orcs.
With Rocar gone, the orcs began to fight among themselves in ensuing power
vacuum. In complete disarray, the orcs no longer posed a credible threat. In a
matter of months, the alliance forced most of the orcs from the low lands. Then,
ironically, the humans who were once slaves themselves enslaved their former orc
masters.</p>
<b>
<p>The Rise of the Humans</p>
</b>
<p>With the skills they learned from their allies and enemies and their
ever-increasing numbers, humans quickly joined the ranks of the great races.</p>
<p>Humans then began to develop their own skills. The humans developed their own
calendar with the first year beginning when the first nomadic tribe discovered
the great lands.</p>
<p>As the human population grew, they spread through out the lands. However,
with no significant external enemies, the various human tribes began to war
among themselves. These human wars occasionally involved their former allies,
the dwarves and elves.</p>
<p>The elves became alarmed by the unchecked growth of the human race. The elves
saw inter-human warfare as a vehicle to keep humans from becoming too powerful.
To this end, the elves frequently supported the losing human tribes to
perpetuate the wars.</p>
<p>However, even given the inter-tribe wars, humans still flourished and
advanced.</p>
<p>Humans develop ships and navigation and began to sail the inner seas at to
nearby islands in the great west ocean. However, extensive exploration of the
great west ocean was prevented by the presents of &quot;Sea Devils&quot; (an
aggressive aquatic race) that attacked any ship on the open seas at night. All
expeditions attempting to cross the Great West Sea are lost</p>
<p>Human made significant advances in medical science which reduced human death
rates and lengthened their life span.</p>
<p>Human kingdom with feudal monarchies rose to power.</p>
<p>Humans mastered wizardry, even exceeding the abilities of the elves who had
taught them.</p>
<p>Year 1125, The First Science Master, Pentock (The first of a series of great
scientists who greatly contributed to human technological advancements),
established the first human university which she called The Academy of Kingdoms.
&quot;We will learn to do everything done with magic today - without it
tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Year 1250 Gun Powder discovered.</p>
<p>With the development of firearms and cannons, the human wars intensify and
evolve all of the human kingdoms. Human monarchies frequently use peasant human
subjects (as well as orc slaves) as cannon fodder in the wars resulting in the
death of thousands of human peasants each year.</p>
<p>Trade between the human kingdoms and the other races expands and a human
merchant class of educated and ambitious non-nobles develops. The merchant class
begins to resent the inaccessibility of the privileged classes.</p>
<b>
<p>1710 Dawn of an empire</p>
</b>
<p>A large group from the merchant class form the Peoples Political Party (PPP)
which declares all humans as equals and demand an end to the class structure
that separate the nobility from peasantry. The PPP is lead by a charismatic and
tireless leader, Ven Tiran.</p>
<p>The King of the oldest and largest human kingdom tries to crush the PPP but a
rebellion ensues and the king and his government are overthrown. The PPP
establishes a human republic. A senate is established with members elected by
citizens. Citizenship is granted to any human over 15 who &quot;proves&quot;
their worth to the republic. (&quot;worth&quot; could be proved in any number of
ways including through military services, art, business, or science) All
citizens are granted rights of protection. The senate quickly imposes military
conscription. This creates an enormous army, which are then well trained.</p>
<p>1725</p>
<p>Ven Tiran rises in power in the republic and is declared Prime Minister and
chief of the military.</p>
<p>Ven Tiran quickly crushes several surrounding kingdoms.</p>
<p>As the republic grows, it was divided into states and territories.</p>
<p>1735</p>
<p>Tiran declares the republic an empire with the destiny to unite all the human
kind within its borders. Tiran is crowned emperor for life.</p>
<p>Printing press - newspapers</p>
<p>Coal and gas power</p>
<p>Dwarves develop steam engine - humans develop railroads</p>
<p>1807</p>
<p>Tiran appoints new emperor just before his death, his &quot;son&quot;, one of
hundreds, Van Tolman</p>
<p>1815</p>
<p>Tolman outlaws slavery of humans.</p>
<p>1820</p>
<p>Tolman outlaws slavery of humanoids (primarily Orcs)</p>
<p>Rebellions ensue but are quickly crushed.</p>
<p>1824</p>
<p>To prevent further rebellions, the Emperor and Senate grant significant
governmental autonomy to the Imperial State and Territory governors and
legislatures. However, Imperial laws, including the ban on slavery, remain
supreme. The Emperor turns most internal empire operations over to Imperial
Senate and governmental bureaucracy but retains power over military. State and
Territories enact significantly different laws. Some States and Territories
allow non-humans to be citizens</p>

<p>The Elves</p>
</b>
<p>There are three major elven races, the High, Wood, and Grey Elves.</p>
<p>The <u>High Elves</u> are the most common member of the elven race. They are
tall, fair skinned, and have light colored hair. They are a civilized, if not
arrogant, forest dwelling race. They are highly educated and capable a producing
some of the finest metal and art work. Wizards and Clerics are not uncommon
among their elite. They are a formidable fighting force when threatened. Though
there are several independent tribes, they all share a common queen who has
supreme sovereignty in times of crisis.</p>
<p>The next most common elven race is the <u>Wood Elves</u>. The Wood Elves are
a more primitive and reclusive cousin of the High Elves. Their skin and hair are
darker in color and they are also somewhat shorter than other elves. They live
primarily in tree dwellings, deep in the forests. They are excellent trapper and
hunters, but they are not nearly as well educated. They also don’t produce
fineries that can compare with those made by the High Elves. Because of these
differences, the High Elves frequently treat their Wood Elves cousins as an
unworthy addition to the elven race and do not include Wood Elves in any of
their activities. This has bread discontent between the two races.</p>
<p>The most rare, but most powerful, race of elves are the <u>Grey Elves</u>.
Many of the greatest wizards of all time have been Grey Elves. They are a highly
magical race capable of unimaginable powers. Few have ever seen them. Very
little is known of them, but they are feared and respected by all other elven
and non-elven races.</p>
<b>
<p>Elven Wars - 1899</p>
</b>
<p>Elves disdain the new human technologies and refuse to adopt the advances.
Imperial industrialization begins to pollute lands. Loggers begin large-scale
clear cutting of forest. The elves become very upset at the rate of destruction
of natural resources. The High Elves try and negotiate limits to imperial
consumption. Negotiation fail and elven-Imperial relation’s cool.</p>
<p>Disputes arise on the border of the elven woods. Elves begin to sabotage
Imperial mining and timber cutting equipment. A group of radical elves capture a
coal power electrical plant and sabotage it. When Imperial authorities storm the
plant, the elves are gone and many human plant workers are found dead. The
Imperial Senate declares war on the elves and request the Emperor to send in
troops. The Emperor delegates the war to his generals.</p>
<p>The elves are found to be nearly invincible in the woods. Using guerrilla
tactics, the Elven tribes defeat Imperial forces battle after battle, but the
imperial leaders are persistent and continue to assaults elven enclaves.
Imperial casualties are significant and the Senate blames the generals for
mismanaging the war.</p>
<u>
<p>The Final Solution</p>
</u>
<p>1904, the Emperor appoints Colonel Westscott to take command of the Elven
campaign. He develops a three part final solution to the elven problem.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Establish an elite military force trained in forest warfare to fight the
    elves - <u>Rangers.</li>
  </u>
  <li>Systematically burn elven forest.</li>
  <li>Break elven alliance by secretly negotiating with the Wood Elves, to
    betray their arrogant elven cousins, the High and Gray Elves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though ineffectual at first, the Imperial Rangers begin to wage successful
attacks on elven strongholds. Millions of acres of elven forest are burned.
Colonel Westscott personally negotiated a secret treaty with the Wood Elves
guaranteeing them large portions of forest free of Imperial incursions. The wood
elves treaty also designates large portions of woods that were currently in the
domain of High Elf tribes. In exchange, the Wood Elves assist Imperial forces in
tracking down and eliminating High Elf resistance. However, the Wood Elves would
not agreed to help the empire against the Grey Elves.</p>
<p>1908, faced with the betrayal by their elven cousins, destruction of their
homeland, and mounting casualties, the High Elf queen commands the High Elves
within the empire to capitulate. A few High Elf tribes refuse to quit fighting
and are forced to flee the Empire. The remaining High Elf tribes are resettled
on reservations. The elven reservations are allowed independence and are not
subject to imperial rule.</p>
<p>Imperial forces are unable to locate and engage Grey Elf forces or
settlements. Colonel Westscott reports to the Emperor and Senate that without
the alliance of the High and Wood Elves, the Grey Elves are no longer a
significant threat to the Empire.</p>
<p>1909, The Elven Wars are officially ended.</p>
<p>The League of Realms offers sanctuary to any elves leaving the empire.
Several High Elf tribes ally with the League and join in their war against the
empire.</p>
<p>Prejudice towards elves is significant throughout the empire.</p>
<p>Imperial States and Territories have occasionally violated elven sovereignty
and treaties. In many of these instances, imperial authorities have intervened
on the elves behalf to thwart State and Territory actions.</p>
<b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Orcs and Dorks</p>
</b>
<p>Bands of orcs in the outer territories and outside the empire are well
organized and even sea barring. They continue to be a threat to those they
encounter.</p>
<p>Though thought of as a lower class, domesticated orcs have been fully
assimilated into the empire. Many can read and are frequently employed in manual
labor positions in farming and construction. The domesticated orcs are commonly
referred to as Dorks to distinguish them from their uncivilized brethren. Many
Dorks have joined the Imperial Armies and a few have even been admitted to
schools of higher education. The Dorks have their own religion and Dork churches
are not uncommon. Though uncommon, a few States and Territories are allowing
Dorks to become citizens.</p>
<b>
<p>Dwarves and Gnomes</b></p>
<p>Dwarves and humans continue trading. Dwarven craftsmanship is considered the
finest. Imperial Territories bordering the Dwarven Mountains allow dwarves to
become citizens. Dwarves are honored and treated with a great deal of respect in
most parts of the empire.</p>
<p>Gnomes are rare but have learned to combine magic and technology like no
other race.</p>
<b>
<p>Currency</p>
</b>
<p>The empire has issued the Imperial Crown as the official currency. Exchanges
using platinum, gold, and silver pieces have been banned within imperial
boarders. However, the ban is not enforced in the outer territories where both
currencies are widely used.</p>
<p>The Crown Currency comes in the following denominations:</p>
<p>Coins - One Crown</p>
<p>half Crown</p>
<p>tenth Crown</p>
<p>penny - 100<sup>th</sup> Crown</p>
<p>Bills - 5, 10, 50, 100 Crown notes</p>
<p>Though the Crown was initially issued at and exchange rate Current exchange
rate of one Crown to a gold piece, inflation in the empire has eroded it value.</p>
<p>The current exchange rate is<b> </b>Rate 2 Crowns per Gold Piece</p>
<b>
<p>Year 1919</p>
</b>
<p>The Empire is struggling. Emperor Talon is very old and is rarely heard from.
The Trench War with the United Realms and Free Elves in the Northwest has
stagnated. Orc raiding and pirating had become a serious problem. There is
religious unrest in Southern Territories and minor rebellions in the Eastern
Territories. A plague rages in the South East. Taxes, the draft, and war
casualties are causing social unrest throughout the empire. Hunger, disease, and
poverty plague many of the major cities. Corruption is rampant.</p>
<p>Political reforms and non-citizen rights legislation is currently being
debated in the Imperial Senate.</p>
