Game Highlights:<br>
The game started in the City of Robar, which is large city, population40,000, in the Imperial State of Arden.  Robar is the headquarters of the
Imperial Marshals.  Aspen, Aune, and Calelith are all imperial Marshals of equal rank.  Robar's climate is warm, not unlike Reno, Nevada.&nbsp;
Chief Inspector Moran sends the novice marshal trio on a mission to find Rick, the
son of Senator Stienwood, who heads the opposition party of the Arden.<br>
<br>
Chief Inspector Moran's mission briefing noted the following facts.  Rick was staying in Black Bay with cattle ranchers Allen and Edith Green
(relatives).   The Greens were the only people in Black Bay who knew Rick's genealogy.  Rick was sent to Black Bay to get him out of the capital, for
safety reasons.  It is not known if his disappearance is linked to him being the son of Senator Stienwood.  Investigations should be tactful, and not
divulge Rick's status unnecessarily.  Rick is missing.  There has been no ransom demand.<br>
<br>
The trio boarded a train heading for Eddington, and then planned to travel to Black Bay, the last known location of the boy by horse (days ride).  Black
Bay is a small fishing/marble quarry community of 1800 inhabitants.  Each marshal brings a horse on the train and is asked to lock their weapons in a
special secure train car.  Calelith complies while Aune and Aspen hide their weapons in their shared train cabin.  Each character starts the journey with
100 crowns and an open charge line back to the marshals.<br>
<br>
During the second night of the trip the train was derailed by a large group of highly
organized and well equipped Orcs (approximately 20).  Marshal and train guards sprung into action to defend the vulnerable train.  Much
gunfire ensued between the Orcs and the train personnel.  The Orcs were herding the passengers away from the train when the Orc leader was killed.
This caused the orcs to retreat without the passengers or train loot.  There were no serious casualties among the train personnel.<br>
<br>
The Orcs were found to be using new guns and grenades.  Both of which they should not have had.  Guns were of strange but familiar manufacture.  The
wood handle type was wrong for the gun.  Grenades are only used by the military.<br>
<br>
Thus ended the first installment of the Special Investigations Unit.  Next game is scheduled for Friday November 25 at the
Schmidt's.<br>
<br>
Experience points gained: 200 points each player<br>
