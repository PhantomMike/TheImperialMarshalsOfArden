<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<p>Day 1:</p>
<p>It is afternoon before we make it to the Green’s Farm. It is a large house
and we are met by a field hand who takes us up to the house. We meet with Mrs.
Green and ask about Rick’s disappearance. Rick had left early one morning two
weeks ago when they didn’t have school. He took a horse and something out of
the barn when he left. Investigations revealed he took a hacksaw, crowbar and
hammer. He had had confrontations with some of the local boys, but was close to
Anna. Anna had been over a lot after Rick’s disappearance. A quick search of
his room uncovered some letters, some from his parents and some from an unnamed
girl. In the girl’s letter she wrote &quot;do not let John get to you&quot;.
Also found an old local map, with an X marked on it North of town, somewhere
near the coast. It was identified as the Haunted Mansion location. The Haunted
Mansion is North of town. Gnolls live over there and the bridge is out over the
river. Rick had spent a lot of his time riding and was friendly with Deputy
Andy. Got a recent picture of Rick. The Greens do not think he ran away. He had
a mission to prove something to someone the last couple of days. Mr. Green
really misses the horse that Rick took.</p>
<p>Went to Anna Brown’s parents dairy farm. Again met by a field hand who took
us to the house. Met Mrs. Brown, a portly, jovial woman who loves to offer
milkshakes. She said Anna had been gone for 5 days and thinks she ran off with
Rick. When Anna left she took a flat bed horse carriage, but they didn’t
notice anything else missing. In her room, found letters from Rick who also
mentioned John. Anna had been upset that Rick was missing, on the last day she
was here, she came home from school and was determined about something. The next
morning she was gone. Anna’s best friend at school is Vesla White.</p>
<p>Went to Vesla’s home - her Dad is the carpenter. Vesla didn’t want us to
go into the house, but would talk on the porch. Anna hadn’t said anything to
her, but Vesla had seen Anna yelling at John Malet before she left. She didn’t
know why Anna was yelling at John or anything about the Haunted House.</p>
<p>Went to talk to John Malet again, Father was present. He admitted liking
Anna, but did not like Rick. Brought in little brother Jack, who confirmed that
Anna and John were arguing. John admitted daring Rick to get a Gargoyle head
from the Haunted Mansion. Aspen excuses himself from the room, and Aune goes and
helps make tea with Mrs. Malet. Aspen searches John’s room and finds 50 crown
and a long elf sword. Its getting late so we go back to town.</p>
<p>Meet with the fishermen and tell them that we had found acid burns on the
dead fish that</p>
<p>were given to us to examine. One of the fisherman says that he has seen an
oily slick on the water. Recommended that they start fishing in deeper water
until we find the cause of the acid burns and also pointed out fishing was
better South of town. Asked them to keep an eye out for anything that might help
explain the acid burns. They reported that the Kelp seems OK, and River Fishing
was also OK. Bought the fishermen a round of drinks. Some young fisherman offer
to go North along the coast and look for anything suspicions. They will fly a
red flag, and gave us a whistle to signal them if we see them from shore.</p>
<p>Before we headed to the hotel, took a look at the Turell who was still locked
in one of the sheriff’s cell. He was doing much better and the doctor had been
to see him.</p>
<p>Day 2:</p>
<p>Next morning is the Turell’s hearing with the Magistrate. The office smells
awful from the sea dragon’s decomposing body, which is promptly removed to
another building. Magistrate O’Connor hears the evidence, but will not release
the Elf because of John Malet’s earlier testimony. However, he will release
Turell into our custody as long as we are investigating the disappearances. We
decide to take Turell with us to the Haunted Mansion.</p>
<p>Headed North along the rode out of town with Turell. When we got near the
Wild Women’s yard, we could see a flat bed horse carriage in the yard and so
investigate to see if it is Anna’s. We see long dead Gnoll heads mounted on
the barn and several ferocious dogs heading towards us. Aspen tames the
ferocious dogs in the yard and the Wild Women confirms it is Anna’s cart - she
had asked her to watch it and her horse then headed towards the river. Back on
the road, we can see the cart tracks going North to the river and then returning
to the Wild Woman’s yard. Turell finds a foot pump for a raft at the river’s
edge. Decide to spend the night on this side of the river as Wild Woman report
the Gnolls are active. Head to the friendly Parishioner’s farm just South of
Wild Woman’s. Parishioners receive us and feed us well. Calelith provides a
lesson on tolerance. Confirm Anna used to visit the Wild Woman and was her
friend.</p>
<p>Day 3:</p>
<p>Next morning cross the river uneventfully. On the other side we find the raft
and can see old human skulls hanging from the tree. We bury the skulls and
perform a ceremony. We head North along the road. Although Calelith is checking
for traps, his horse steps on a Caltrop and throws Calelith. He nimbly avoids
any damage and Aspen treats the Horse. We find 6 old rusty Caltrops and pick
them up. Still checking for traps, we continue North. Calelith stumbles across a
buried trap, but jumps out of the way. In the hole are new spikes, blood, and
part of a bridle. We decide to leave the horses at the Parishioners. So we
return to the River, Aspen crosses with the horses and returns on the raft.</p>
<p>When we get back to the trap, Calelith sees 1 Gnoll guarding the path and 5
restoring the trap. When they head into the woods, we follow. Calelith
inadvertently sets off an alarm and tries to make it look like a branch had
fallen on it instead while quickly retreating. We get off this trail by about
100’ and stand defensively. There are 4 Gnolls on the trail and 2 coming
towards us off the trail. Calelith uses his &quot;make audible noise&quot; spell
to make it sound like we are running towards the road. The Gnolls fall for it
and run by us without noticing. We continue along the trail, but we trip another
alarm. There are now 3 Gnolls coming at us from their camp. We can see several
young Gnolls and one really big one in their camp. There is no sign of either
Rick or Anna ever being there. We start to leave going parallel to the road and
perpendicular to the trail and stumble across a small Gnoll. Calelith’s sleep
spell works and we continue on our way hearing the Gnolls behind us. After
diagonalling towards the road, we run across a Mansion road and take it east to
the main road. Farther up along the main road, we see a clearing and in the
clearing is a horse - Rick’s horse. The saddle is askew and the horse is beat
up. Aspen works his animal charm and so we take it with us to the Haunted
Mansion road. It is getting dark and the Gnolls are still following us in the
distance.</p>
