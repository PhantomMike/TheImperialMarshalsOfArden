<u>
<p>Picking Up the Pieces</p>
</u></b>
<p>Following the gun play with five armed thugs, the party was in a desperate
situation. With the exception of Aune, all were seriously injured. Aspen was
rendered unconscious from a near-fatal chest wound, but was revived after a
short while. (Note that Aspen was relatively inactive for the rest of the
following day and night due to these injuries.) Calelith, and Turell were also
both seriously wounded in the fight. Having expended all magic resources, the
injured were bandaged as well as possible under the circumstances.</p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p>Following the administering of first aid, the room was thoroughly inspected
by Aune. Only eight of the ten bunks in the room appeared to have been in use
recently. The trunks in the room contained a variety of personal items: food,
wine, and miscellaneous supplies. It was noted that the thugs did not appear to
share common uniforms. An assortment of valuables were confiscated, totaling 9
Gold pieces, 27 Crowns, 13 Silver pieces, a gold necklace, a diamond earring, a
ring, and a bracelet. In a gun locker were found 2 rifles, 2 pistols, and an
enormous amount of ammunition (in addition to the guns used by the thugs).
Searching further, a foreign crate marked &quot;Roberto’s Find Cloths&quot;
was discovered, containing contraband clothing.</p>
<p>During the investigation of the room, the sole surviving thug regained
consciousness. Questioned by Aune and others, he revealed that he was simply a
hired hand recruited from a local town, who hauled loads and moved crates around
in the underground tunnels beneath the mansion. The tunnels, he said, lead to a
hidden cove, where an underground stream connects to the sea. He described some
of the smuggling going on, and gave accounts of his boss, associates, and other
&quot;lizard things&quot;. When asked how many others were still in the tunnels,
he admitted that there were still three others unaccounted for, and possibly
some monsters. He also described two prisoners held below in the tunnels; a
young girl, and an Imperial agent.</p>
<b><u>
<p>The Prisoners</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party entered the tunnels through a door in the barracks room. The
injured thug was tied up and brought with them, escorted by Aspen. Aune led the
way down the dark, slippery staircase, sneaking quietly. Off in the dark of the
tunnel, the party heard a pair of voices discussing the fate of one of the
prisoners. Calelith suddenly shown a flashlight on the two thugs, and demanded
that they surrender. Instead they cursed and began running away down the tunnel.
Calelith fired at the fleeing pair, wounding one in the rump. In the end, they
made good their escape. With the element of surprise gone, the party quickly
searched and found the two prisoners, bound but not seriously hurt. The girl
turned out to be Anna, while the man appeared to be in an Imperial uniform. Aune
threw them over her shoulder and the party quickly made it’s way back up the
stairs into the barracks room, where they secured the door and untied the
prisoners.</p>
<p>Anna told her story, of how she came to the Haunted Mansion to find Rick. She
did find him, but she was captured and Rick was taken away. Then a second male
prisoner was thrown in with her.</p>
<p>The male prisoner turned out to be an Imperial Border Patrol officer named
Halse. He had been investigating a warehouse near Edington when he was jumped by
surprise and taken here for questioning by &quot;Sabbath&quot;. Despite being
recently treated like a sack of potatoes, he gladly joined the group of Imperial
Marshals in combating the thugs in the Mansion. Anna also pledged her support,
and took a weapon.</p>

</font><b><u>
<p>Through the Master’s Door</p>
</u></b>
<p>Earlier, while searching the barracks room, the party had noticed a door into
the Master’s room which was warded with magic runes. The party now turned its
attention to getting into this room. A considerable amount of discussion and
preparation ensued. In the end, the door was blown open with a shotgun and
Calelith and Aune rigged up a device to toss a body (of one of the slain thugs)
in through the opening. This worked, and Calelith was able to recover Halse’s
magic book and sword. While searching the Master’s room, Calelith also found a
box containing four potions, three of which appeared identical.</p>
<p>The party then began planning their next move. It was suggested that they
should leave the mansion, but it was a known fact that there were Gnolls in the
woods. Another suggestion was to hide in the mansion and rig booby-raps for the
thugs. During these discussions, Halse persuades Calelith to try one of the
three similar potions, and sure enough they turn out to be &quot;Healing
Potions&quot;. The other two potions were quickly consumed! Having healed
somewhat, the party is emboldened to reenter the tunnels and clean out the
thugs.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Battle with the Cellar Thugs, Round 2</p>
</u></b>
<p>Moving once more into the tunnels, the part split up to explore a fork in the
passage, with Halse going one way and Calelith going the other. It was Calelith
who encountered the Green Slime dripping from the ceiling, and he hurriedly
removed his contaminated clothing. Taking the lead once again Calelith then
tripped a grenade trap, which exploded and would have killed him if not for his
&quot;Shield&quot; ability.</p>
<p>Further down the tunnels, the party heard sounds from thugs who were now
alerted by the grenade trap going off. A second grenade trap was spotted, and
around a bend the thugs appeared to have set up a defensive position. The second
grenade trap was disarmed, and pretending to be a fellow thug Halse crept up to
the bend in the tunnel. Halse then threw a grenade, and the party opened fire.
Behind a barricade were three thugs and two Gnolls. The grenade was poorly
placed, and did not appear to injure any of the thugs. Halse’s opening shot
did take the head off of one of the thugs, but return fire badly injured Halse.
Aune’s shot missed, and she too was hit with return fire. Calelith injured one
thug, and fortunately return fire only grazed him. Under a hail of fire, the
party retreated. Back upstairs, the doorway again was barricaded and the
stairway trapped with Green Slime. (Round 2 went to the thugs.)</p>
<b><u>
<p>Bump in the Night</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party fortified their position as best they could to wait out the night.
Halse set up three gun traps, one for each doorway into the Mansion. Watches
were assigned, and the party tried to get what rest it could. During the second
watch, Halse was alerted to the sound of a gun trap going off. Waking the party,
he went to investigate. Sounds were heard upstairs of someone bumping around up
there! Turell accompanied Halse to have a look around, and he spotted a skiff
leaving the cliffs at the water’s edge, carrying two thugs. Also, a flashing
signal light was sighted off shore, and it appeared to be a ship signaling the
Mansion. (And &quot;things&quot; were sighted swimming in the waters!) Calelith
came above to relieve Turell, who went back below. Then, Calelith’s keen night
vision picked out someone making their way off into the night carrying a box.</p>
<p>Calelith and Halse decided to track the thug with the box. He left a trail of
blood; a sign that the gun trap had done it’s job. Calelith succeeds in
following the trail, which took them down to the water where they spied a single
man rowing out to sea on a skiff. Calelith and Halse shot the thug off of the
skiff, and the skiff slowly drifted back to shore. The box which was taken was
found to contain a signal lantern, but more importantly the skiff afforded an
opportunity. Calelith suggested using the skiff to sneak up behind the
barricaded thugs in the tunnels. And so . . .</p>
<b><u>
<p>Battle with the Cellar Thugs, Round 3</p>
</u></b>
<p>Calelith and Halse rowed into the cave opening in the cliff face and beached
the skiff at the underground cove. Not taking any chances, Calelith crept up
behind the thugs and threw a grenade in a surprise attack. Halse also threw in a
grenade, and the combined attack was quite successful. The large Gnolls,
however, were not immediately defeated, and one began chasing Calelith. Halse
managed to distract it, allowing Calelith to throw yet another grenade. Pulling
his gun, Calelith then shot and killed one badly weakened Gnoll, before turning
and shooting the last surviving Gnoll who was engaged in hand-to-hand combat
with Halse. (Round 3 went to the Empire!)</p>
<b><u>
<p>At Game Conclusion</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party, still badly in need of rest and relaxation, had at last secured
the Haunted Mansion - - for now. There is still the threat of a ship off shore,
Gnolls in the woods, and things swimming in the waters. More booby-traps may
still remain in the Mansion, and the party is injured and out of magic. But an
new day is dawning, and who knows . . .</p>
