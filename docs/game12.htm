    Airfield</u></b></span></dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">We
    begin with the party flying along in the commandeered mail plane from
    Roahock Airfield.&nbsp; The flight is pleasant, the weather is good, and the
    fuel is plentiful - something must be wrong!&nbsp; Fortunately for the party
    Aspen is a skilled pilot and manages to get them all well out of harms
    way.&nbsp; Unfortunately as Aspen nears the supposed location of Arden
    Airfield he finds himself lost.&nbsp; The landmarks are unfamiliar and there
    are no charts in the plane due to the hasty way in which the party departed
    Roahock.&nbsp; Fortune once again smiles on the party as Aspen eventually
    recognizes his uncle's farm.&nbsp; From there we follow the train tracks in
    towards the capital.<br>
    <br>
    Soon thereafter the party notices another plane off in the distance.&nbsp;
    It closes in and is quickly identified as an imperial fighter.&nbsp; Aspen
    nods to the pilot as he nears and there is indication that we should follow
    them.&nbsp; We are soon joined by several other planes as escort which help
    us find our way to the Arden Airfield.<br>
    <br>
    Arden Airfield is absolutely crawling with activity, apparently the imperial
    military was no longer going to underestimate the power and determination of
    Maloe to retrieve what was once his from the party.&nbsp; After landing the
    party is greeted by Colonel Roberta Scott, mother of Major Scott, Captain
    Sparks, a wizard warrior who is actually glowing (how rude!), and Secret
    Service Agent Darrell who is wearing a dark suit and glasses.&nbsp; Colonel Scott welcomes the party.&nbsp; Aspen is pleased to find out that that the
    mail plane they have commandeered is theirs to use as they see fit!</span></dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><u><b>To
    the Palace</b></u></span></dt>
  <dt>The party leaves the airfield in a blue armored car, escorted to the
    imperial palace by the rest of the dignitaries that welcomed them.&nbsp; We
    use the time to catch up on what has happened since we left Roahock.&nbsp;
    Apparently Maloe and his cronies left soon after the party flew away, and
    they haven't been heard of or seen since.&nbsp; Along the way towards the
    palace Aune feels a &quot;presence&quot; around her.&nbsp; She believes it
    may be an elemental presence of some sort, probably either air or
    earth.&nbsp; When the party gets about 40 miles from the palace they reach
    the outer boundaries of the palace security area and curiously Captain
    Sparks indicates he must leave at this point. Apparently he is not
    authorized to enter the palace grounds!</dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><u><b>Arden
    Palace</b></u></span></dt>
  <dt>Finally arriving at the Palace proper there are many guards around.&nbsp;
    Security is very strong there and Aune once again detects an elemental
    presence.&nbsp; This time she believes that there are air elementals flying
    around the entire palace area.&nbsp; A butler greets us and prepares to
    escort us to our rooms. The guest quarters are huge and luxurious, with
    private baths and regal decor.&nbsp; Unfortunately the party's gear arrival
    was delayed when we departed Roahock so we didn't have any appropriate
    attire to greet the emperor.&nbsp; Calelith asked about the availability of
    some more appropriate clothing and as quick as a snap a tailor is dispatched
    to measure up the entire party and enquire about what sort of clothing we
    would require.&nbsp; After much deliberation the party decides on thematic
    formal clothing for the entourage utilizing a blue and burgundy theme.<br>
    <br>
    Once discharged to their rooms Aune decides to partake in a bubble bath
    while Calelith and Aspen decide to wander around the palace grounds and
    chambers.&nbsp; Calelith makes his rounds covering as much of the buildings
    as he can, all along making careful mental note about its overall structure
    and layout.&nbsp; After a few hours the tailor returns for a second fitting
    and soon after the party is escorted to the dining hall for dinner.</dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><u><b>Dinner
    in the Palace<br>
    </b></u>The party is happy to see Inspector Moran waiting for them at the
    dinner table.&nbsp; It's been a while since we've seen him and it's good to
    catch up on all the happenings that have been going on.&nbsp; Moran
    indicates the party has been doing a really super job and that soon they
    should be reporting back to him again.&nbsp; The plan at this point is to
    give the emperor the key and fill them in on everything we have seen and
    learned.</span></dt>
  <dt><br>
    <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">As
    everyone enjoys the seafood dinner the party inquires about the marble they
    had purchased many weeks ago in Black Bay.&nbsp; Moran seems to be concerned
    yet amused by the whole thing.&nbsp; Apparently eventually the marble
    purchase was funded by a rider that was attached to another bill.&nbsp; A
    post office in a small backwards town had developed a leaking roof and other
    problems and was soliciting funding for its repair.&nbsp; Now the town's
    post office is the pride of the county as it is all rebuilt using the fancy
    marble the party had purchased!</span></dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><br>
    </span></dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><b><u>Meeting
    with the Imperial Advisors</u></b></span></dt>
  <dt>After dinner the party went back to their rooms where their new clothes
    were waiting for them.&nbsp; Soon it was time to have an audience with the
    emperor so we are escorted to a meeting room.&nbsp; Colonel Scott and Agent
    Darrell are there along with Moran.&nbsp; Eventually 3 imperial advisors
    arrive, clothed in monk-like robes.&nbsp; The advisors ask the party about
    all that they have found and ask to see the key.&nbsp; They tell the party
    that they have been researching the key and its associated legend since they
    heard about our findings and will now use the key itself to help finish
    their work after a few days.&nbsp; The party is advised that the evil druid
    Maloe has been using the key and the wand Calelith took from him to identify
    the parties whereabouts by scrying.&nbsp; In order to prevent Maloe from
    finding the party again they must part with these two objects.<br>
    <br>
    Eventually Aune is convinced that the key will be safe with the advisors in
    the palace and pulls out the key to give to them.&nbsp; Calelith also agrees
    to surrender the wand, fortunately the advisors offer to replace it with
    similar device that holds 20 spell points of charge.&nbsp; The meeting goes
    well and the advisors invite the party to stay at the palace for two days
    until their research is complete and at which time a special ceremony will
    be held in honor of the party!</dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><u><b>Hanging
    out at the Palace</b></u></span></dt>
  <dt>Everyone enjoys the prospect of a little free time to rest and relax in
    the lavish surroundings of the palace.&nbsp; Aune decides to study history
    for a few days and engage in some practice and training with the guards in
    the barracks.&nbsp; Halse decides to join her in the military training as
    well.&nbsp; Calelith decides to hang out in the shipping and receiving area
    of the palace, he's very interested in the commerce which is going on there.
    (?!)&nbsp; Aspen decides to pretty much just hang out and relax during the
    respite.<br>
    <br>
    Calelith discovers that the shipping and receiving area does not seem to be
    anywhere near large enough to accommodate all the supplies that must be
    necessary to keep the palace running but doesn't figure out what is truly
    going on there.<br>
    <br>
    Aune is pleasantly surprised to find out that the boxes of chocolate the
    party acquired from the smugglers is indeed extremely valuable here in
    Arden.&nbsp; The tailor indicates that each box has a value of 500
    crowns!&nbsp; Aune decides to trade two boxes of the rare confectionary for
    a lovely party gown and set of jewelry.</dt>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><b><u>Ceremony
    in honor of the Imperial Marshals of Arden</o:p>
    </u></b></span></dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">The
    day of the ceremony finally arrives, the party finds itself in a big banquet
    room full of dignitaries and plenty of scrumptious food.&nbsp; It is there
    that we once again meet up with Rick Green and hear the familiar
    &quot;howdy&quot; of Anna, Rick's girlfriend.&nbsp; We also meet, amongst
    others, Rick Green's father Senator Green and the Prime Minister
    herself.&nbsp; There is much discussion of all the party has gone through
    and how much appreciated our efforts are.&nbsp; It's clear the party is
    considered to be a &quot;rising star&quot; in the eyes of the Arden
    empire.&nbsp; Our incident involving the train wreck was in all the
    newspapers and of course our rescue of the Senator's son has made us real
    heroes in the eyes of the government and common folk.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, with the party finding itself surrounded by all sorts of powerful
    political figures there was ample opportunity to inquire about certain
    controversial government practices and to make &quot;suggestions&quot; about
    how things could be improved in the empire.&nbsp; Aune expresses concern
    about her homeland being annexed while the politicos do their best to spin
    the action in a positive vein.&nbsp; Calelith also jumps in to the foray by
    announcing that he is deeply concerned about the lack of equality for
    non-human races in the empire.&nbsp; When will non-humans be considered
    equals and citizens?&nbsp; Calelith is not particularly gratified by their
    proclamation that due to his great deeds he, at least, is now an honorary
    citizen of the empire!&nbsp; Aspen finds himself having a great time and
    finds nothing whatsoever to complain about.<br>
    <br>
    Eventually the Prime Minister snaps her fingers to gather the attendants
    attention and reads a lengthy proclamation.&nbsp; In defense of the empire
    and the senate, due to our great deeds in handling the train wreck incident
    and in rescuing Rick Green, the party is awarded with the grand Imperial
    Star.&nbsp; The party soon after finds out that these are the only Imperial
    Stars awarded this entire year and that the medals were bestowed upon the
    party by a unanimous vote in the Senate!&nbsp; Rising stars indeed!</span></dt>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman">Later
    in the evening the double doors at the end of the banquet room finally open,
    the eldest Imperial Advisor greets the party and asks us to follow him down
    the hallway.&nbsp; At the end of the hallway we enter another room where we
    gather around a large desk.&nbsp; The Advisor extends his gratitude to the
    party for all we have done and expresses the regrets of the emperor who will
    unfortunately be unable to meet us.&nbsp; (Aspen begins to wonder if the
    emperor really even exists at this point.)&nbsp; We are informed that they
    have discovered that Maloe is now intending to construct another key to gain
    the access he seeks, it is unclear whether he will succeed or not.&nbsp; The
    best plan, now, is to take the key we have and go and retrieve whatever part
    of the relic sword it will unlock.&nbsp; Only then will it's safety be
    assured.&nbsp; The key is presented back to the party in a thick metal box
    that will prevent it from being located by scrying.&nbsp; A special magical
    glyph is put on it so that only the party can unlock it without
    danger.&nbsp; A similar form of protection is applied to a small chest
    containing 50000 GP worth of gems.&nbsp; We also get a bottle containing
    four teleportation pills that we can use to instantly bring us back to the
    palace once our mission is complete.&nbsp; The Advisor tells us that the
    entire resources of the the empire are at our disposal to accomplish this
    great mission.</span></dt>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  <dt><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><b><u>At
    games end...</u></b><br>
    The party is in the process of preparing for their journey down to the
    peninsula of Dartmen where hopefully we will be able to identify and
    convince a powerful Gnome cleric to bless the key so that we may use it
    without danger of having our heads bashed in.&nbsp; We also debate what
    method of transportation we will use, perhaps a twin engine flying boat may
    be the best form of transportation for the next leg of this journey...</span></dt>
