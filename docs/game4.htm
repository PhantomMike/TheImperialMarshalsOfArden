Day 1:
</font></p>
<u>
<p>Pursued by Gnolls</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party was still being pursued by the gnolls. Rather than confront the gnolls, the party decided to continue on to the haunted mansion. The party still
had the Green’s prize horse. Aspen and Calelith lead the party attempting to
detect traps along the way.</p>
<p>Calelith discovered a trip wire attached to a poison needle trap. He removed
the poison needed and gave it to Aune to investigate. She determined the needle
was tipped with a non-lethal poison. She kept the needle.</p>
<p>While traveling along the road, an apparition appeared in the road in front
of the party and warned &quot;turn back or you will meet your death&quot;. It
then decomposes and disappeared before their very eyes.</p>
<p>Aspen detected the tracks of a small number of humans and gnolls that had
traveled the road together within the last few days.</p>
<p>The party encountered a mysterious moss patch on the road and decided to go
around it.</p>
<b><u>
<p>The Haunted Mansion</p>
</u></b>
<p>Towards the end of the road the party finally saw the mansion on top of bluff
overlooking the ocean. The road lead to a main gate in an eight foot wall that
surrounded the mansion.</p>
<p>Calelith poked his head through hole in the wall and noticed four skeletons
standing motionless behind the wall by the gate. Aune noted that the skeletons
did not radiate undead. The party avoided the skeletons by climbing through a
breach in the wall.</p>
<p>Aspen determined that the gnoll and human tracks he had seen earlier lead to
a side door of the mansion but the sun had set and it became too dark for him to
track any further.</p>
<p>Aune and Calelith investigated the mansion by looking in its windows while
Aspen and Turell kept watch out for the gnolls Aune and Calelith did not see any
signs of light or life in the mansion but Aune noticed the floor on the north
side of house was warmer than the rest of the house. Aune also sensed some minor
undead under the south side of the house</p>
<b><u>
<p>Gnoll Attack</p>
</u></b>
<p>Six gnolls came up the road. The party took up a defensive positions behind
the wall.</p>
<p>When the gnolls were in range of his spells, Calelith stood on the wall,
announced in the gnoll language that they were Imperial Marshals and ordered the
gnolls to surrender. However, the gnolls did not oblige and four of them charge
the party while the remaining two began to shoot arrows and throw spears.
Calelith cast <u>color spray</u> and the four charging gnolls were all knocked
unconscious. The rest of the party shot it out with the remaining two gnolls.
Protected by his shield spell, Calelith stood on the wall and taunted the
remaining gnolls in an attempt to draw their fire. It worked and the two
remaining gnolls were quickly gunned down by the party. The party tied up the
four remaining gnolls who soon regained consciousness. Though Calelith tried to
reason with the them, the gnolls seemed bent on destroying the party. Because of
their size, it was obvious that the ropes would not hold the gnolls for long.
After an extensive ethical debate, the party decided their only reasonable
alternative was to &quot;dispatch&quot; the remaining gnolls else they would
certainly attempt to kill the party or other innocents in the future. Aspen
killed the gnolls and the party dropped their bodies off the cliff.</p>
<p>The party decided it was too late to investigate the mansion that night and
decided to make camp just outside the mansion walls. They took turns taking
watch in case more gnolls showed up but the night past uneventful.</p>

Day 2:
</font></p>
<u>
<p>Investigating the Haunted Mansion</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party rose early to investigate the mansion. They entered the side door
noted earlier.</p>
<p>Upon entering the mansion, a voice from above bellowed out &quot;Welcome to
your doom!&quot; Aune still did not detect any evil or undead on this side of
the house. Calelith noticed the that the voice appeared to be coming from a
wizard’s &quot;magic mouth&quot; spell and surmised that the
&quot;haunted&quot; mansion was a ruse and that some sort of wizard had cast a
bunch of spells in the area to make the mansion appear haunted.</p>
<p>The party moved through the house modestly investigating each room they past.
While in the kitchen a poisonous centipede leaped from the sink onto Calelith’s
back. Fortunately Aune and Aspen were able to knocked it off and kill it before
it could do any harm. Other centipedes could be heard from the sink so the moved
on to another room. The party encountered their first locked door to a room off
the kitchen. Calelith successfully picked the lock and the party entered the
pantry and quickly noticed that this room had been swept. A stair case lead down
to the cellar and the party proceeded down the stairs. Another voice from above
bellowed out &quot;welcome to your doom&quot; . The party ignored the voice and
proceeded.</p>
<p>The room smelled of something rotting. It was dark so Aune took out her
flashlight and Aspen his lantern. The room was a wine cellar with empty wine
racks along the wall and a couple of bins by the west wall. A body of a man lay
in the middle of the room. The man was wearing plate mail and had a sword. But
his belt seemed to have been removed. The party investigated the body and
determined that he probably had been dead for a couple of weeks and that his
plate mails was still in very good shape.</p>
<p>Aspen and Calelith began to search for secret doors. Calelith found one on
the west wall and Aspen figured out how to open it.</p>
<b><u>
<p>Battle with the Cellar Thugs</p>
</u></b>
<p>Upon opening the secret door, the party noticed light and voices coming from
the other side. The party quietly opened the door and Calelith snuck in to
investigate. Calelith saw five armed humans sitting at a near by table playing a
board game. The room was large with 10 bunks lining the west wall. The party
decided on an attack plan and went into action.</p>
<p>Calelith ordered step into the room and announced that the party were
Imperial Marshals and ordered the humans to surrender. The humans were startled,
stood up and began to draw weapons. Calelith cast another color spray but
unfortunately this time he only knocked out one the opponents. Aune immediately
followed using a &quot;command&quot; spell and ordered another of the humans to
fall asleep. Aspen and Turell closed for hand to hand combat with their long
swords. Of the remaining three humans, one pulled a sword and the other two
pulled out pistols.</p>
<p>Aspen attacked the sword wielding human and delivered a near fatal blow and
knocked him off his feet. At the same time Calelith cast a shrink spell on the
sword wielding human and shrunk him to nearly half his size. Turell Landed a
solid blow on one of the humans with a pistol while Aune shot and wounded the
other with her revolver. The two humans returned fire seriously injuring both
Aspen and Turell. The battle continued between the party and the two remaining.
Aune and Calelith fired their revolvers while Aspen and Turell fought hand to
hand with their swords. Then when of the humans critically wounded Aspen. A
bullet passed through his chest and out his back. Aspen fell to the floor
unconscious. Then Turell was again seriously injured to the point he also
collapsed to the floor. But fortunately Turell remained conscious. But at that
same point, the party had managed to kill one of the gunmen. Enraged by gunning
down of his companion. Calelith pulled his out his rifle but before he could use
it, he was shot and seriously injured by the remaining gunman. Knowing that the
next shoot would most likely kill him, he dove for cover. The remaining gunman
took his next shot at Aune he hit her but his bullet bounced off her armor. Aune
notice the injured and shrunken human that had previously had a sword was
pulling out a shotgun and she shot and killed him. The human that Aune had
commanded to sleep was waking up and Turell, still on the floor wounded, reached
over and took the humans revolver, pointed it at a grenade on the humans belt
and told him not to move.</p>
<p>Aune gunned down the remaining gunman. The previously sleeping human decided
to attempted to pick up one of the revolver on the ground. Turell shot at him
but missed, fortunately Aune also shooting at him and hit him with a critical
shot.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the battle, four of the humans were dead and one was
still unconscious. But Aspen was unconscious with a critical chest wound and
both Calelith and Turell are seriously wounded. Aune used here two remaining
spells to heal Aspen. This stabilized his condition but he did not regain
consciousness. Calelith tied up the remaining unconscious human. Aune
laid-on-hands healing on Turell and used her medic abilities and both Turell and
Calelith.</p>
<p>The party notice that their are two other doors leading out of the room. The
one that leads in the direction of the undead that Aune senses is marked with a
danger sign. The other door is unremarkable. There is also a stair case at the
other end of the room leading up to a trap door in the ceiling.</p>
<b><u>
<p>At Game Conclusion</p>
</u></b>
<p>The party is in a serious situation. Though not immediately threatened, each
is at risk. At the moment Aspen is unconscious with a serious chest would that
will limit his abilities until he recovers. Calelith is still seriously wounded
with little spell ability remaining for the day. Turell is also seriously
wounded and would not last long in another fire fight. Though uninjured, Aune
has used up all her healing and spells for the day. All this and it’s not even
10 o’clock in the morning.</p>
