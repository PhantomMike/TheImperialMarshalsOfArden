Game Highlights:<br>
Day 1:<br>
The game began by doing a slight reversal back in time to the evening just after the Orc attack on the train ensued.  That evening the passengers gathered up their wits while the train officials, NPCs, and the party scouted out the area and set up a watch for the evening. The party also decided to attempt to track the trail (using Aspen's great skill) of the evil Orcs to see what further information could be found.  After approximately 4 hours of tracking was done a rough camp was found.  Calelith snuck up to the outskirts of the camp and observed 18
Orcs and a power struggle ensuing.  He found that they were all armed with new firearms and they were packed up and apparently ready to leave.  Calelith stole a pack but found nothing interesting in it.  He then used a Color Spray
(Calelith's signature spell) to disable a guard Orc from which he obtained several more grenades.  Calelith then fashioned a note for the disabled
orc indicating he and his party were under arrest for attempted train hijacking and that they should report to the nearest officials for punishment.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Day 2:<br>
The next day the rescue train arrived and began transferring people and property over so that the trip could be completed.  Officials from the train and the local militia accompanied the party back to the Orc camp site where it was found to be abandoned except for 3 dead orc bodies.  A squad of men was left at the site to scout out the area and investigate further.  One gentleman on the train was caught paying off the train guards to watch a large heavy box during the transfer process.  The contents of the box were not ascertained by the party.<br>
<br>
Day 3:<br>
The train arrived in the town of Eddington (the capitol of the territory) the next day.  We met a secret service agent, Mr. Saret, and briefed him on what had transpired. We parted company with the NPCs, with the exception of the Colonel who drove Aune and Aspen in his car to their next destination, Calelith rode in a hired truck with the horses and gear.  Passage to Black Bay was uneventful with the exception of a pumpkin meeting the windshield of the truck along the way, courtesy of a goblin along the side of the road.  The Colonel was given a grenade and sent off to join the battle at the frontier.<br>
<br>
Party arrived in Black Bay and got rooms at the inn there in the town that was recommended by Kate.  There was an Elf named Turell being held prisoner in the town center.  The Elf was being held on suspicion of abducting a girl named Anna recently. Met Sheriff Bunco and his deputy nephew named Andy.  There were several conflicts of word and wit with Bunco and the party over the manner in which the Elf situation was handled, thus the party decided to do some of its own investigation on what happened there.  Party suspects the elf was ill accused due to prejudice and lack of a common spoken language.  Aune healed the elf as he was near death.  The rest of the day was spent with Aune spending time with the town priest and the rest of the party getting more information from town inhabitants.  There is evidence that the abducted girl Anna was a good friend of Rick Green.<br>
<br>
That evening when the townsfolk returned from fishing Aune feared for Turrell's life because some fishermen spoke of sacrificing the Elf as a way to increase their catch.  Party discovered that a pagan religion had somewhat resurged in the town due to the terrible fishing that had been going on in the past 6 months.  Aune convinced the townsfolk to have faith in the true God and that in time things would be righted.  The townsfolk bought in although they are expecting results sooner rather than later!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
A dead sea-devil was also brought in that evening by the fishermen which apparently was worth a bounty.  The state of the body indicated some sort of external disease or contamination killed the creature.  Party surmises at this point that there is some sort of pollution causing the death of the fish in this area. Aspen spent part of the evening in a bar with the fisherman getting information on the situation of the Elf's capture and the identity of his accusers.  Calelith was somewhat threatened by the drunken sailors since he is an elf but the situation was handled well and no blood was shed.  Party spent the night in shifts watching
Turell to make sure he wasn't harmed by drunken sailors.<br>
<br>
Day 4:<br>
Next day Aune watched the elf while Aspen and Calelith visited the quarry.  There wasn't too much of interest at the quarry, met the main guy named Mr. Piten and didn't find any evidence of the quarry work causing contamination.  (Visiting the quarry was also part of the false premise the party gave for visiting Black Bay, that of evaluating marble for the construction of some government buildings.) Aspen and Calelith then went to visit the family and talk with Jake and John which confirmed their suspicion that the elf was taken due to misunderstanding and prejudice.  Aspen, Calelith, and the brothers went to visit the site of the Elf abduction and with a little scouting around found Turrell's pack there, clearly indicating that little if any investigation was done concerning the situation.  Back in town the party confronted Bunco with all the new evidence and Bunco agreed to move the Elf into the jail and allow him to receive a just hearing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Aune spent time this day with the town priest and examining some dead fish that were brought back by fishermen.  Her theory was confirmed at this point that there is some sort of pollution or chemical cause for the poor state of sea-life in this area.<br>
<br>
The party sent a telegram to Colonel Brennen up North along the frontier (approximately 200 miles north of Black Bay on the coast) asking if there was evidence of dead fish up there.  Brennen responded that there was no evidence of anything going on like that.<br>
<br>
At the end of the session Calelith expressed some regret in not combating the "pumpkin goblin" earlier...<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
Next game is December 11th at the Schmidt's.<br>
