<p><b><u>The plan</u></b><br>
The game started by running the characters that had remained on shore while the
rest of the party went on an &quot;unplanned&quot; foray out to
meet/secure/destroy (what were they trying to do out there anyhow?) the smuggler's
ship.&nbsp; Aspen, Turell, and Anna decided to take the prisoners (Sabeth and
Larry) back up through the cavern to the mansion so they could safely await the
return of the rest of the party.&nbsp; Unfortunately this plan was short-lived
as the &quot;charmed&quot; lizard men were on a path to rescue their master.</p>
<p><u><b>Lizard Ambush<br>
</b></u>Anna took the Larry at the head, watching over him with her shotgun,
while Aspen and Turell drug Sabeth behind her.&nbsp; The party did not get much
past the barricade in the lower reaches of the cavern before Aspen heard
something going on behind them.&nbsp; Four lizard men appeared crawling over the
barricade, and at that point there wasn't much choice.&nbsp; Aspen rolled a
grenade their way which did substantial damage but they persisted in their
attack, with two of them engaging Aspen and Turell in the narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>No sooner had the first round of attack occurred when Aspen and Turell heard
the unmistakable blast of Anna's shotgun going off...two shotgun shells had put
an end to the lunging thug, fortunately for Anna's sake.&nbsp; Similarly
fortuitous for the party two of the lizard men were put out of commission pretty
easily, one unconscious by Aspen and the other killed by Turell.&nbsp; As the
second two lizard men engaged them it appeared they took a new tact, they were
trying to grapple the party.&nbsp; Aspen was grabbed pretty quickly and was
unsuccessful at breaking the lizard's grip.&nbsp; Eventually Aspen took a
critical hit from the lizard's bite and went down, fallen but not
unconscious.&nbsp; Turell decided to turn the tables on his lizard by attempting
to grab and turn him into the line of site of Anna's shotgun, she had closed
back to the party after fending off the attack of Larry.&nbsp; Unfortunately
her shot was off and no damage was done.</p>
<p>The lizard man that had knocked Aspen down proceeded past Turell towards Sabeth, it was clear he was bent on releasing his master.&nbsp; Turell realized
he had to prevent the lizard from releasing Sabeth or all would be over when he
was freed.&nbsp; The lizard was furiously trying to untie Sabeth to the point
of completely ignoring Turell, who was directly behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this
point Turell decided that there was no stopping the lizard, his only choice was
to take out Sabeth.&nbsp; A fierce blow to the neck ended Sabeth's days, and
with that the lizard men broke out of the charm spell long since cast by Sabeth upon them and they soon left the area returning to their pool.</p>
<p>Aspen attended to himself and Turell, along with Anna they went on back to
the barracks where they nursed their wounds.</p>
<p><u><b>Back together again<br>
</b></u>The rest of the party soon came back.&nbsp; At this point they were able
to communicate with the lizard man priest and were able to come to a mutual
understanding.&nbsp; It was explained that the smuggler's ship would be coming
back at the end of the day.&nbsp; It was also interesting to note that nobody
was at all sad to see Sabeth gone, obviously not the lizard men but neither Ned
nor the rest of the smugglers either.&nbsp; The party learned that Ned was an
accountant for the Syndicate and was part of the sea-going smuggling that was
going on.&nbsp; It was noteworthy though that the Syndicate did not take any
credit for the firearms that were part of this operation, the blame for that was
purely put on Sabeth.</p>
<p>Ned, although full of useful information, also did very well at getting the
party very angry at him and nearly killing himself.&nbsp; While inspecting
documentation that Calelith had collected on the operation here, and
simultaneously going through some of the paperwork on the desk in the cavern he
spoke a few magic words causing the entire desk to blow up.&nbsp; This knocked
out Ned, although he survived, and most but not all of the evidence was
destroyed.&nbsp; Fortunately a substantial portion of the smuggler's log was saved by
Calelith from the flames of the blast.&nbsp; Bryon was subsequently informed
that all future prisoners of the party are to be assumed to be
gagged...</p>
<p>The party also became very familiar with an invisible hobbit sent by the ship
to help &quot;watch over&quot; the proceedings there at the haunted mansion
before they returned.&nbsp; The hobbit, named Punt, was invisible and not a very good friend
of Calelith's.&nbsp; There were several instances of taunting from the little
man and each time Calelith lunged for him, only to fail to find his
target.&nbsp; However, Punt taunted once too often, for Calelith's efforts
eventually were rewarded by a firm handle on the little fellow's legs.&nbsp; A
struggle ensued while Aspen attempted to assist Calelith in hand-cuffing
him.&nbsp; Punt went as far as to swing his sword at Calelith, which was not a
good idea.&nbsp; Eventually Punt was subdued, knocked out, handcuffed and
gagged.</p>
<p><u><b>Them Bones<br>
</b></u>You'd think at this point that there wouldn't be much left for the party
to do at the Mansion but you never know what everyone is thinking.&nbsp; There was still the
issue of the barricaded door, beyond which Aune could sense the presence of
undead.&nbsp; It was her duty to dispatch the evil minions and eventually a plan
was devised to take care of them.&nbsp; Neither of the thieves were successful
at picking the lock on the door (and neither was Aune initially at pulling the
bar off of it either, poor finger nails...) so Anna's shotgun was used as the
&quot;key&quot; to get it open.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five skeletons were indeed present in the narrow room, and they soon animated
to attempt to do their evil on the party.&nbsp; Aune was completely successful
at turning the skeletons though and they had nowhere to go but away to the end
of the room against the wall.&nbsp; Two grenades from Aspen were all that were needed to turn the animated undead into a
scattered pile of splintered bones.</p>
<p>A secret door was exposed out of this room that lead to an old alchemy
laboratory.&nbsp; All matter of lab equipment and magic components could be
found there, along with gold objects and several magic items.&nbsp; Halse was
able to identify all the magic in the room and Calelith was able to identify 3
of the 6 potions.&nbsp; The room
wouldn't have been complete without the dried up corpse of the presumed
alchemist who had perished here still sitting at his desk.&nbsp; The
party packed up most of the goodies in this room, keeping some of the magic and
gold for themselves.</p>
<p><u><b>Justice is served<br>
</b></u>The rest of the day involved Aune and Calelith going back on the
fisherman's boat to meet with the authorities and contact our superiors.&nbsp;
The bulk of the smuggled goods were impounded and set up to be shipped back to
town and the prisoner Ned was turned over.&nbsp; Anna was returned to her family
and Turell's name was cleared of the accusation of being involved in her
disappearance.&nbsp; The Syndicate smuggling ring is now broken up and Sabeth
has been stopped from supplying weapons to outlaw paramilitary groups in the Empire.&nbsp;
Finally, the discovery of chemicals used in the water to help the smugglers
protect their operations at night explained why Black Bay was having its fishing shortage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While back in town Calelith was also able to arrange for a map to be
air-lifted to the Haunted Mansion site from our superiors.&nbsp; The map
contains a schematic of the &quot;Keep&quot; on the Realm island
that supposedly holds Rick Green.&nbsp; This island is the next destination
along the party's mission to free the young man...&nbsp;</p>
