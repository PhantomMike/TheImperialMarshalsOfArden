    the escape route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition

    investigating the area around the cesspool thus cutting off the planned

    to use a rope and climb down the wall and make a run for it. Calelith goes
    first and is promptly seen by the workmen who call out “beer man!” and

    in the tower and walked down the steps to greet the workmen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    warning shots. Calelith made himself the primary target by placing himself
    at the back of the flee Party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One

    </span>They couldn’t go directly to the boat without being seen and guards
    were approaching from the village and the castle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    would climb down the closest cliff to water line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    decided to take a water breathing position and try and swim for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    </span>Two weeks ago, the Empire began a major offensive on the Front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    savage desperation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Intense

    </span>To Colonel Brennen’s surprise, Rodenberg still maintained a

    </span>Caught in the cross fire, hundreds of civilians were wounded or
    killed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Colonel Brennen hastily

    destroy the city and retreat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
    would be tricky because if the main offensive bogged down then it would be
    difficult for the Imperial forces to maintain air superiority over

    </span>He ordered the destruction of the city and began preparations for the

    ammunition dumps throughout the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    dumps were destroyed using incinerating explosives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The destruction of the dumps had the deadly side effect of releasing
    significant amounts of poisonous gas from stock piles of chemical weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    were specialist in chemical warfare and possessed the necessary equipment

    </span>Among the dead left over from the initial assault, new bodies began

    </span>Clearly the elves had not been in the city during the initial attack,

    </span>The Colonel called on the expertise of an Imperial Wizard Warrior,
    Captain Cane, who was assisting in the Rodenberg operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>The Captain determined that the elves had only recently died, most
    likely from poisonous gas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
    also appeared from traces of residual magic radiating from the bodies that
    they had been hidden from detection using invisibility spells.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    Black Force would have ever known these elves were ever in the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

    were just a myth.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span>But why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why would a
    Grey Elf enter an occupied city in the middle of a war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Captain Cane went to investigate the area where the bodies had been
    found.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Colonel contacted
    the Military Intelligence Network (MIN) to determine if Realm forces were
    aware of an elven infiltration of Rodenberg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>When Captain Cane returned, he informed the Colonel that he had found
    evidence that these elves were not alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>At least three sets of “foreign” tracks had been discovered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The tracks were recent and lead to the Cathedral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>MIN had reported that they did not believe that the Realm leadership

    Scott escorted the Party to Colonel Brennen’s operation headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>When the Party entered the colonel’s office, they found him arguing
    with a Black Force officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    colonel’s Imperial Army Green clashing with the plain black uniform of the
    Black Force officer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    argument ended with the colonel yelling “Just do it!” and the Black
    Force officer barged out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    Colonel turned around and see the Party and smiled for the first time in
    weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Finally, real people
    to talk to,” he shouted.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    member, Halse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Colonel
    apologizes to the party for the carnage they’ve seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>“You are not seeing the Empire at its best, but it is necessary”
    he says. The Colonel explained the situation, introduced Captain Cane, and
    took the Party to see the dead elves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
    examining the Grey Elf, Aune determined that he was relatively young and a
    cleric of a radical religious sect within the Grey Elf community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Calelith determined that one of the High Elves appeared to be a
    fighter/wizard but was unable to locate his spell book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    discussion ensued about the best way the party could gain admittance to the
    cathedral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Colonel
    mentioned that the refugees in the cathedral were probably in pretty
    desperate shape and Aune suggested taking water, food, and supplies to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>“We’ll be the Red Cross bringing aid” Aune explained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>They all agreed on this approach and the Colonel put Major Scott in
    charge of assembling the supplies for the refugees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>A pile of medical supplies, a barrel off water, and a stack of food
    rations were collected and put into a hand cart. Calelith decided he would
    go unarmed pushing the cart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aspen
    kept his sword and bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Aune

    religion, they left the temple alter intact and in place.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span>While Aune attempted to translate the ancient writings on the alter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Though no traps or secret doors were noticed, Aspen and Calelith
    quickly noticed some obvious scrape marks on the floor on one side of the
    alter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The scrapes had recently
    been made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From damage that
    could be seen at the bottom of the alter on the same side, it appeared that
    the alter had been slid to one side and then slid back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Aspen check for tracks and found a set of three leading to one side
    of the alter and then just disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>Aune did not find any special meaning in the ancient writing on the
    alter and decided to try and pushed on the side of the alter to see if it
    could be easily moved, but it didn’t budge. Calelith checked to see how
    the three garrison soldiers were reacting to the Parties inspection of the
    alter, though it is clear that the soldiers were watching them (along with a
    hundred refugees), they did not appear to be to particularly agitated or
    concerned at the Parties current location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span>Aspen again looked for some secret handle or place to put some kind
    of key or offering that could reveal a hidden entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    </span>He said he hadn’t but he did not spend much time in this area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>He suggested asking one of the refugees who has settled nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The party asked the women refugee nearest the alter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>She said a couple of days earlier (she is not sure if it was one or
